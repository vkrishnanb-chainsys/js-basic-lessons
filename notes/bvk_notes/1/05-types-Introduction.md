1. Boolean  
2. Object  
3. Number  - All numbers like integers, decimals, and floats 
			 are all one type .
4. Null -   
5. Undefined -  
6. String  
7. Symbol - (new into js) used for assigning unique id . 
			Always gives a guaranteed unique identifier

Everything in the above list are `Primitive type` except Object.  
An Object is a special type.  
Every thing other than primitive types in js are Objects.  
At the end of the day, Functions, arrays, dates are all just objects.
