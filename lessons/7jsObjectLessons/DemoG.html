    <!--We’ve already seen the hasOwnProperty(), propertyIsEnumerable(), and isPrototypeOf()
    static functions defined on the Object constructor, such as
    Object.create() and Object.getPrototypeOf()-->
    <!--The toString() Method
    The toString() method takes no arguments; it returns a string that somehow represents
    the value of the object on which it is invoked.JavaScript invokes this method of an
    object whenever it needs to convert the object to a string.-->
    <!--The toLocaleString() Method
    The purpose of this method is to return a localized string representation of the object. The
    default toLocaleString() method defined by Object doesn’t do any localization itself:
    it simply calls toString() and returns that value. The Date and Number classes define
    customized versions of toLocaleString() that attempt to format numbers, dates, and
    times according to local conventions. Array defines a toLocaleString() method that
    works like toString() except that it formats array elements by calling their toLocale
    String() methods instead of their toString() methods.-->

    <!--The valueOf() Method
    The valueOf() method is much like the toString() method, but it is called when Java-
    Script needs to convert an object to some primitive type other than a string—typically,
    a number. JavaScript calls this method automatically if an object is used in a context
    where a primitive value is required. The default valueOf() method does nothing interesting,
    but some of the built-in classes define their own valueOf() method (see
    Date.valueOf()-->
