6. Remove properties from o if there is not a property with the same name in p. Return o.
   function restrict(o, p) {
       // your code goes here
	return o;
   }

7 For each property of p, delete the property with the same name from o.
  Return o.

  function subtract(o, p) {
	// your code goes here
	return o;
 }
